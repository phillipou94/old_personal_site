    <p>Jonathan Haidt’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777">The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</a> helped me understand how people formulate their beliefs, how to better express my own, and also how to properly appreciate new ones.</p>

    <p>I did some research ahead of writing this post and was surprised to find that these events happened more than a year ago—May 25, 2020. The fact that it feels much more recent is likely a testament to how this tragedy is still reverberating in our minds.</p>
    <p>By the end of that week, demonstrations would break out in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_George_Floyd_protests_in_the_United_States">550 different cities across the country</a> and 5,000 members of the National Guard would be deployed nationwide to stem what <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-11590844180">Wall Street Journal</a> called “the worst civil unrest in decades.”</p>
    <p>My exposure to these events were primarily through hashtags on Twitter, black squares on Instagram, and reading hyper-charged discussions all over the internet.</p>
    <p>As city after city instituted curfews to reign in the hostility, my social media feed became a narrow window into the justifiable shock and horror erupting all across America. I couldn’t remember a time when the real emotions people were feeling were so palpable online.</p>
    <p>The video that surfaced made sure that the horrifying details of Floyd’s homicide were clear as day. However, the discussions about the activities and institutions surrounding this tragedy seemed messier and more contentious.</p>
    <p>I read political columns that claimed rioting is never an effective, coherent, nor moral response to injustice. I saw police officers push back against the growing animosity against their entire profession. I heard friends declaring that signaling “allyship” by re-posting black squares on Instagram was just hollow virtue signaling.</p>
    <p>Depending on who you asked, the existence, cause, and solution to racism in America seemed to occupy different realities.</p>
    <p>As participation swelled, I remember being conspicuously silent and feeling hopelessly conflicted. It stung when friends would point out that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/2/21278123/being-an-ally-racism-george-floyd-protests-white-people">“antiracism is about doing and not just knowing”</a> and it was clear that I wasn’t doing anything. My silence—some of them would say—signaled a lack of concern towards these issues.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, while I did think about topics like police brutality, criminal justice reform, and systemic racism, I neither had the courage nor conviction to offer more than just “yeah it’s complicated” when these topics issues came.</p>
    <p>Specifically, I struggled giving meaningful responses to 3 critical questions posed to me:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>“Do <em>you</em> support the rioting?”</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>“Do <em>you</em> think America is racist?”</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>“How are <em>you</em> going to be an ally?”</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The thought of potentially offending someone scared me and I fell back on an old habit of deflecting contentious discussions.</p>
    <p>But there’s more at stake and I wanted to figure out how I could participate in this significant change in our public consciousness. Instead of just jumping in out of guilt or obligation, I wanted to engage in these conversations in a personally meaningful way.</p>
    <p>I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777">The Righteous Mind</a> by Jonathan Haidt hoping I could better understand my own biases, beliefs, and values. Equipped with that knowledge, I felt more comfortable having these discussions in ways that felt principled and sincere.</p>
    <p>In this edition of Bookie, we’ll dive into my favorite takeaways from this book and then explore how they impacted my responses to those 3 questions above.</p>
    <h1 id="favorite-takeaways">Favorite Takeaways</h1>
    <h3 id="our-morals-are-driven-by-our-instincts">#1: Our morals are driven by our instincts</h3>
    <p>We often think of morality as a collection of widely-accepted rules: Always tell the truth. Treat others as you want to be treated. Keep your promises. Put down the toilet seat after.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4021e6f-804d-4544-aaa0-f47688cff5d6_1000x1001.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4021e6f-804d-4544-aaa0-f47688cff5d6_1000x1001.jpeg" alt="white printer paper with dont mean text overlay" title="white printer paper with dont mean text overlay"></a></p>
    <p>My favorite rule! Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ashleywhitlatch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ashley Whitlatch</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rules?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>
    <p>We’re taught these rules so early on it’s hard to discern whether these virtues are biological impulses or man-made ideas that we’ve been indoctrinated to believing.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Do people believe in human rights because such rights actually exist, like mathematical truths, sitting on a cosmic shelf next to the Pythagorean theorem just waiting to be discovered by Platonic reasoners?</p>
    <p>Or do people feel revulsion and sympathy when they read accounts of torture, and then invent a story about universal rights to help justify their feelings?</p>
    <p>-Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Haidt argues that there are no universal truths. People have gut feelings about right vs. wrong and then rationalize these feelings post hoc. In other words, “moral reasoning” is just our brains justifying what our instincts have already decided.</p>
    <p>Over time, our experiences reinforce or—on rare occasion—reorient these gut feelings.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.</p>
    <p>-Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’ll pause here and caveat that this next section will read a lot like a sociology textbook. I won’t be offended if you just gloss over it but I do think it’s valuable knowledge.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_foundations_theory">Moral Foundations Theory</a> suggests that our “gut feelings” can be dissected into six fundamental principles that we inherited as a result of our evolution. It explains why morality can vary so much across people, groups, and cultures yet still exhibit many similarities and recurring themes.</p>
    <p>These 6 moral principles function a lot like tastebuds. Just like how people can react differently to the same food, we respond uniquely depending on our sensitivities to each moral principle.</p>
    <p>The saying “All models are wrong, but some are useful” definitely applies here.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how accurately Moral Foundations Theory describes what actually happens in our brains, but these 6 principles offer a really useful tool to pinpoint where people’s beliefs originate from.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3 id="the-6-principles-of-moral-foundations-theory">The 6 Principles of Moral Foundations Theory</h3>
    <h4 id="careharm">1. Care/Harm</h4>
    <p>We value kindness towards those that are vulnerable and despise cruelty. This likely evolved from a need to keep our children alive and our groups tight-nit.</p>
    <p>Liberals (generally) fixate on this principle more than others. Conservatives (again generally) are more parochial—concerned about care/harm towards their group, rather than all of humanity.</p>
    <h4 id="fairnesscheating">2. Fairness/Cheating</h4>
    <p>We value reciprocal altruism and want to punish liars and cheaters. Good-faith cooperation was pivotal to our survival and this sentiment is hard-wired today in our desire for rights and justice.</p>
    <p>However, “fairness” can have different interpretations. Liberals focus on <em>equality</em> (e.g. everyone needs to pay their “fair share”) whereas conservatives focus on <em>proportionality</em>—people should be rewarded in proportion to their contribution to society even if it generates unequal outcomes.</p>
    <h4 id="loyaltybetrayal">3. Loyalty/Betrayal</h4>
    <p>We value self-sacrifice for the good of the group and punish those who betray us. We’re especially sensitive to signs of whether or not someone is a team player.</p>
    <p>Liberals tend to be less inclined towards this foundation, often disparaging nationalism and American foreign policy. Conservatives, in response, tend to interpret these criticisms as betraying our country and institutions.</p>
    <h4 id="authoritysubversion">4. Authority/Subversion</h4>
    <p>Beyond cooperation, adopting specific roles became important organizing principles in the evolution of our species. As a result, we’re sensitive to signs of rank, status, and whether or not people are behaving according to their position.</p>
    <p>This foundation resonates more with conservatives and less so for liberals who are skeptical of hierarchies and the inequalities of power structures.</p>
    <h4 id="sanctitydegradation">5. Sanctity/Degradation</h4>
    <p>Sacredness help bind communities around a shared principle, making that group feel unique and even destined for greatness. It’s why we assign extreme value to objects, symbols, ideas, and stories.</p>
    <p>For example, “sanctity of marriage” or “sanctity of life” are often-referenced ideas by religious conservatives. Sanctity can even apply to what we’re allowed to do with our own bodies which is still be a hot-button religious and political topic.</p>
    <h4 id="libertyoppression">6. Liberty/Oppression</h4>
    <p>We believe that legitimate authority needs to be earned. We are resistant to authority without purpose because unchecked power can negatively impact our individual liberties.</p>
    <p>What constitutes oppression differs between liberals and conservatives. While liberals are concerned about large systems of oppression that disenfranchise <em>other</em> groups, conservatives are more worried about oppression of their <em>own</em> groups (e.g. “Don’t tread on <em>me</em> with high taxes, <em>my</em> business with regulations, or <em>my</em> nation with international commitments”)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Through this lens, I started noticing how people’s opinions following Floyd’s murder signaled which moral foundations resonated with them.</p>
    <p>Care/Harm was almost universally felt given the horrifying nature of the Chauvin and Floyd video.</p>
    <p>However, the topic of rioting produced wildly different narratives depending on your sensitivity to Liberty/Oppression vs. Authority/Subversion foundations.</p>
    <p>For some, an extreme system of oppression required a necessarily extreme reaction to rectify. A looted Target was a small price to pay to shed light on decades of authorities and institutions abusing their roles in society (Liberty/Oppression).</p>
    <p>For others, the protests were unproductive exhibitions at best and lawless destruction of property at worst—nothing more than people disrespecting authority and undermining law &amp; order in our country (Authority/Subversion).</p>
    <p>We some saw other principles activated too:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Some police officers pushed back against police reform, bristling at the notion that their own institution had problems that needed to be managed by non-police members (Loyalty/Betrayal Principle)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>People argued that removing statues of confederate generals or kneeling during the national anthem disrespected our military, our heritage, and our country (Sanctity/Degradation Principle)</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on which foundation resonates with you, the reality of a situation can seem very very different.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We are deeply intuitive creatures whose gut feelings drive our strategic reasoning. This makes it difficult—but not impossible—to connect with those who live in other matrices, which are often built on different configuration of the available moral foundations.<br>
    -Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="morality-binds-and-blinds">#2: Morality binds and blinds</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Wouldn’t it have been most adaptive for our ancestors to figure out the _truth…_rather than using all that brainpower just to find evidence in support of what they wanted to believe?</p>
    <p>That depends on which you think was more important for our ancestors’ survival: truth or reputation.</p>
    <p>-Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Pre-historic predators weren’t particular kind to early humans who lacked a desire to seek social approval. We were much more likely to survive belonging to groups and evolution selected against traits that didn’t help us stay connected to our tribe.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b66ebb-3a60-479e-bddf-a1fa8e73871d_1462x1264.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b66ebb-3a60-479e-bddf-a1fa8e73871d_1462x1264.png" alt=""></a></p>
    <p>“evolution selected against traits that didn’t help us stay connected to our tribe”…2017 Phil did not get the memo</p>
    <p>Today, isolation doesn’t directly spell doom but we’re still concerned about how others in our group think of us. When interacting with others in our tribe, we seek praise and approval while avoiding blame.</p>
    <p>Codifying morals helped tribes establish a shared understanding of how to coexist and cooperate. It provides group-certified principles to guide our behavior, maintain our reputations, and even ammunition to recruit others to take our side in conflicts.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Our moral thinking is much more like a politician searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth.</p>
    <p>-Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>People really care about their tribes. Whether it’s religious, ethnic, or political, we make judgements based on our identity and participation in these groups.</p>
    <p>Identifying as good Christians or good Democrats or good Americans reinforce the moral foundations that originally drew us to those groups.</p>
    <p>Today, it’s easier than ever to engage with like-minded people and we’re increasingly likely to think those outside our group are blind when they present views that contradict our own.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>In moral and political matters we are often groupish, rather than selfish. We deploy our reasoning skills to support our team, and to demonstrate commitment to our team.</p>
    <p>-Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The influence of social pressure is well-studied—see the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html">Asch Conformity Experiment</a>—and I saw it play out when discussing the events back in May with people I knew.</p>
    <p>Friends in law enforcement felt unjustly vilified by calls to defund the police. Business-owning family members believed that their livelihood and even safety would be threatened by these protests. Immigrants who experienced their own brush ups with racism thought police brutality and systemic racism were just gross exaggerations serving a political agenda —“<em>We</em> encountered racism too. You don’t see <em>us</em> rioting.”</p>
    <p>Their beliefs were very much tied to the groups they identified with—almost like a badge signaling their membership. Even though I didn’t agree with these views, my proximity to them made it personally challenging to voice my disagreement.</p>
    <p>I’m not proud of this but in this critical moment where people were debating important issues, I remained silent—paralyzed by this fear of alienating myself from the groups in my life.</p>
    <h3 id="to-settle-differences-seek-to-understand-before-seeking-to-persuade">#3: To settle differences, seek to understand before seeking to persuade</h3>
    <p>The Righteous Mind helped me start building the muscle memory to frame conflict as an opportunity to learn, to synthesize opposing view points with humility, and to build my own convictions with the understanding that they can evolve with new information.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If you want to understand another group, _follow the sacredness…_And if you really want to open your mind, open your heart first.</p>
    <p>The persuader’s goal should be to convey respect, warm, and an openness to dialogue before stating one’s own case.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Jonathan Haidt</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Understanding Moral Foundations Theory and the influence of group identities gave me the vocabulary, but learning how to listen and evolve was what allowed me to better articulate my view points.</p>
    <p>We explored this idea a bit in our <a href="https://bookie.substack.com/p/the-biggest-bluff">last newsletter</a>: You’re not trying to get people to “see the light” when discussing opposing views. You’re building a foundation of trust that’ll help both parties get a glimpse into each other’s thought process, the beliefs they hold sacred, and how they see the world that you’re both occupying.</p>
    <p>You build trust by listening and really understanding what people value and find sacred.</p>
    <p>Ask: What moral foundations resonate with them? How do they identify with this particular group? How would they characterize the reality that they and their group are living in?</p>
    <p>I found out that people were much more receptive to my views if they believed that I was genuinely open to receiving theirs. This doesn’t mean that I should always concede my point of view. It just means that I should be open and receptive them evolving.</p>
    <p>I pause and ask myself: What do I believe? What are the facts? What would make me reconsider?</p>
    <p>Being transparent about your answer these questions go a long way toward building credibility for your point of view—especially if you kindly invite debate and listen intently to see if your opinions change.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If you have a friendly interaction with someone with different moral matrices, you’re much more likely to understand them better. You might not always change your mind, but you will respect their opinion more.</p>
    <p>-Jonathan Haidt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h1 id="re-articulating-my-beliefs">Re-articulating my beliefs</h1>
    <p>For the sake of practicing what you preach, I want to circle back on those 3 topics I struggled discussing back in May.</p>
    <p>You may disagree with me, I may be misinformed, and my views on these topics could evolve over time.</p>
    <p>But I do want to share what I expressed to friends and family after reading this book as an exercise in re-examining my own beliefs, biases, and assumptions.</p>
    <h4 id="“do-you-support-the-rioting”">1. “Do <em>you</em> support the rioting?”</h4>
    <p>While the vast majority of protests in 2020 have been peaceful, there were actual instances of rioting following May 25, 2020. It’s certainly hard to see neighborhoods and businesses looted and ruined—destroying livelihoods and threatening people’s sense of safety.</p>
    <p>But I also try to understand what would compel someone to hurl a brick through a window during this time. I’ve come to the conclusion that this happens when people believe that there are few legitimate options to have their plight truly heard. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/917022/riot-language-unheard-martin-luther-king-jr-explained-53-years-ago">once said</a> that “A riot is the language of the unheard.”</p>
    <p>Are there more effective ways to protest than to destroy property? Probably.</p>
    <p>But protests and riots erupted during the civil rights movement as well. And while some <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/agenda-seeding-how-1960s-black-protests-moved-elites-public-opinion-and-voting/136610C8C040C3D92F041BB2EFC3034C">studies showed that those riots pushed white voters away</a> from supporting the movement, very few of us look back on those events today and view them negatively.</p>
    <p>We don’t label civil rights activists as “rioters”, “thugs”, or “degenerates.” We remember those events as a small part within broader collective action that ultimately made our society a little more fair and just.</p>
    <p>It’s undeniable that a group of people feel severely disenfranchised. And while it’s easy to criticize the efficacy of their response, we shouldn’t allow that to detract from trying to solve the underlying problem.</p>
    <h4 id="“is-america-a-racist-country”">2. “Is America a racist country?”</h4>
    <p>We can spend hours combing through evidence of wage gaps, unbalanced incarceration rates, unfair zoning laws, or unconscious bias. We can spend even more time debating the root cause and the right solutions.</p>
    <p>But I’ll be brief and simply state that I believe our country has institutions and social structures that exasperate racial and class inequality.</p>
    <p>Derek Chauvin violently pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for 8 whole minutes was just one of many instances of police brutality against men of color who are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/study-supports-suspicion-that-police-use-of-force-is-more-likely-for-blacks.html">more likely to be victims of excessive force</a>.</p>
    <p>Too often I see this question devolve into “Do you think (white) <em>Americans</em> are racist?” I’m not convinced that the right thing to do is to force certain groups of people to “atone for their privilege”.</p>
    <p>We should be able to acknowledge these inequalities and try to rectify them without demonizing, punishing, or seeking retribution against a privileged group.</p>
    <p>While I don’t claim these will fix a deep-seated problem, I’ve been supportive of reevaluating how our justice system handles sentencing, addressing unconscious bias in our communities, and teaching a more holistic view of American history beyond the White/European-centered lens that is baked into most public school curriculums.</p>
    <p>There are different ways to bring awareness and “level the playing field” and I can’t claim to know which methods are best.</p>
    <p>However, I do believe it’s worthwhile to spend our energy highlighting these inequalities and trying things that give people avenues to succeed based on their own merit.</p>
    <h4 id="“how-are-you-being-an-ally”">3. “How are <em>you</em> being an ally?”</h4>
    <p>I’ve never been particularly comfortable with adopting the term “ally”. For me, it’s a label that reinforces a group identity which can perpetuate the “us vs. them” dynamic that makes discourse difficult.</p>
    <p>Instead, I’ll reframe this question as “How are <em>you</em> educating yourself about the problem and how are <em>you</em> helping to solve it?”</p>
    <p>For me, reading this book and writing this post are modest first steps in that journey.</p>
    <p>I don’t see my destination as finding a perfect solution to these problems or even knowing everything there is to know about race and inequality in America.</p>
    <p>Instead, I want to commit to a humble but also personally meaningful goal: thinking critically about what I believe, why I believe it, and how I can better incorporate the views of others.</p>
    <p>A silver lining in this awful tragedy is that people were forced to discuss topics that they never had to previously.</p>
    <p>Whether they’re about race, identity, or politics, I want to make sure I’m well-equipped to engage and grow alongside these difficult conversations.</p>
