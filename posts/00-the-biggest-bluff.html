<h1 id="the-biggest-bluff">The Biggest Bluff</h1>
<p>Maria Konnikova‚Äôs book,  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Bluff-Learned-Attention-Master/dp/052552262X">The Biggest Bluff</a>, not only inspired me to start playing poker but gave me new ways to think about my career, my relationships, and what actually brings me joy.</p>

<h1 id="the-tldr">The TL;DR</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Chance is just chance: it is neither good nor bad nor personal. Without us to supply meaning, it‚Äôs simply noise. The most we can do is learn to control what we can‚Äîour thinking, our decision processes, our reactions.</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="how-i-found-this-book">How I found this book</h1>
<p>I took a calculated risk in December 2020 and went back to LA to spend the holidays with my parents. The regular Christmas and New Years this year parties were replaced by Zoom calls where everyone crammed onto their respective living couches and waved at the other rectangles on the screen.</p>
<p>You still get some semblance of quality time with loved ones but there‚Äôs nothing like someone‚Äôs contorted expression freezing on screen to remind you of how disconnected this pandemic can make us feel.</p>
<p>A few folks on our ‚ÄúVirtual NYE Zoom Party üéâ‚Äù were reminiscing about the semi-regular poker game we‚Äôd host around this time of year.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no guarantee it happens every year and I rarely play even when it does. And when I do play, I just accept the fact that my $5 buy-in is going to the finance bros who actually play poker during their free time.</p>
<p>It was more of an annual afterthought if anything.</p>
<p>But after yet another large Zoom call navigating someone‚Äôs spotty Wi-Fi, I found myself reminiscing about those games in someone‚Äôs drafty garage. I pictured all of us tossing chips, drinking cheap beer, and ribbing each other for bad play.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs funny how even mundane activities suddenly carry so much significance when they‚Äôre not accessible to you anymore.</p>
<p>I even started fantasizing about winning all of my money back the next time this group gets back together.</p>
<p>When I found  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Bluff-Learned-Attention-Master/dp/052552262X">The Biggest Bluff</a>  on Amazon, I actually thought it was going to be a beginner‚Äôs guide on how to play poker‚Äîmy key to unlocking amateur poker success in 2021.</p>
<p>I realized three pages in that it was not quite what I was looking for, but one passage piqued my interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hoped to learn how to make the best decisions I possibly could, not just at the card table but in the world. Through poker, I wanted to tame luck‚Äîto learn to make a difference even when the deck seemed stacked against me.</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maria tells a story about how she started a project writing about pro poker players and then wound up becoming a pro poker player herself.</p>
<p>We see her go from not even knowing the rules of the game to winning some of poker‚Äôs most prestigious events. Along the way she reflects on her challenges learning poker, understanding human nature, and handling the unrelenting randomness life throws at us.</p>
<p>It seemed to me like a self-help book wrapped up in a really interesting personal story and in the spirit of #NewYearNewMe I pressed on.</p>
<p>Turns out,  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Bluff-Learned-Attention-Master/dp/052552262X">The Biggest Bluff</a>  wasn‚Äôt the poker guide I was looking for, but it became one of the most valuable books I read this past year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe in the noise of the universe that chugs along caring nothing about us, our plans, our desires, our motivations, our actions. The noise that will be there regardless of what we choose or don‚Äôt choose to do.</p>
<p>Variance. Chance. That thing we can‚Äôt control no matter how we may try. But can you really blame us for trying?</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>

<p>Any gathering of poker players will inevitably come with a steady drumbeat of ‚ÄúBad Beat‚Äù stories. You held a pair of aces and then lost to someone‚Äôs of 3 of clubs turning into a flush. You had a flush that ended up getting beat by a straight flush. You made the ‚ÄúGame Theory Optimal‚Äù play and still end up losing to the guy who went all-in without looking at his cards.</p>
<p>These are my own personal ‚ÄúBad Beat‚Äù stories by the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c4475e-c5f3-4b53-8b83-510c102a6a1a_480x270.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c4475e-c5f3-4b53-8b83-510c102a6a1a_480x270.gif" alt="Card Games Poker GIF by PokerStars" title="Card Games Poker GIF by PokerStars"></a></p>
<p>No matter how small the dollar amount, these bad beats are soul-crushing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Unlike chess, which is a game of perfect information, making the mathematically best play does not guarantee that you win. Good decision-making maximizes your chances of success but your fate is still very much in the hands of what cards ultimately get dealt. In poker, you can do everything right and still lose all your money.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs kind of like how we should eat our vegetables because they‚Äôre good for us but we shouldn‚Äôt expect that alone to make us great athletes (more on this later).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People failed to see what the world was telling them when that message wasn‚Äôt one they wanted to hear. They liked being the rulers of their environment.</p>
<p>When the environment knew more than they did‚Äîwell, that was no good at all. Here was the cruel truth: we humans too often think ourselves in firm control when we are really playing by the rules of chance</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We tend to overestimate the amount of control we have over critical moments in our lives. This is what makes failure jarring.</p>
<p>I felt this most poignantly as an athlete in high school. My 17 year-old self was absolutely convinced that I was destined to be a Division I basketball player. I woke up every morning at 5 AM to run sprints and put up shots before school started and then stayed late after practice to get in extra hours of work. I felt like I worked harder so I deserved this opportunity more than anyone else.</p>
<p>But despite doing all the right things, I was still getting outplayed by players who could just roll out of bed and effortlessly achieve the the sort of athletic success that I wanted for myself. There are few things more disheartening seeing a college basketball coach walk right passed you to shake someone else‚Äôs hand after a game.</p>
<p>Some people were just born to play basketball and it was becoming clear I wasn‚Äôt one of those people.</p>
<p>I ended up riding the bench at a Division III school before ultimately quitting after a semester. ‚ÄúDollar-Store Jeremy Lin‚Äù would be a generous characterization of my basketball career (and an awesome idea for athletic merch).</p>
<p>Not catastrophic in the grand-scheme of things but it was absolutely devastating to a teenager who had to internalize how I had failed despite trying my best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The benefit of failure is an objectivity that success simply can‚Äôt offer.<br>
-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My failure echoed a similar lesson Maria learned while playing poker. It‚Äôs true that hard work, preparation, and determination will increase your chances of landing your dream job, signing that new client, or, in my case, achieving athletic success.</p>
<p>But success is not guaranteed and we‚Äôre certainly not entitled to that outcome.</p>
<h3 id="you-can‚Äôt-control-the-outcome-but-you-can-control-your-decision-making">#2: You can‚Äôt control the outcome, but you can control your decision-making</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Poker isn‚Äôt just about calibrating the strength of your beliefs. It‚Äôs also about becoming comfortable with the fact that there‚Äôs no such thing as a sure thing‚Äîever. You will never have all the information you want, and you will have to act all the same. Leave your certainty at the door.</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around the same time, my first months in college also forced me to come to grips with the fact that I was not as smart as I thought I was. If the proverbial 3-legged stool of my identity was (1) being good at basketball (2) being really smart (3) being above 6 feet tall, than my identity was teetering precipitously on just 1 leg.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7b80a9a-dc70-4736-8198-9e392b0e09d3_1230x731.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7b80a9a-dc70-4736-8198-9e392b0e09d3_1230x731.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We have moments like these with every setback‚Äîgetting passed up for a promotion, going through a breakup, not achieving a goal we had worked so hard for, etc. When our identities become so tied to the outcomes and achievements we expect for ourselves, failure fundamentally challenges who we are.</p>
<p>I had framed so much of my life as winning some sort of self-defined contest. Becoming a Division I athlete, getting good grades, and going to a good university were points on a public score board that validated me. They‚Äôre worthwhile goals, but my failures to achieve them forced me to realize two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I needed to separate what I‚Äôve done versus who I am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I needed to focus more on the inputs I  <em>can</em>  control rather than the ultimate output.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Really exceptional poker players identify as life-long learners rather than ‚Äúgreat poker‚Äù players. They find joy in navigating the poker‚Äôs crazy uncertainty and randomness.</p>
<p>To them, the game isn‚Äôt defined by a single hand, a single session, or even a single tournament. Instead, they see poker as a never-ending game that rewards sound decision making, consistent improvement, and not letting short-term failures derail a continuous journey of growth and reflection.</p>
<p>Looking back, my identity crisis forced me to really reflect on what gives me energy and purpose beyond just being an ‚Äúexcellent student‚Äù or a ‚Äúgreat basketball player‚Äù.</p>
<p>I started reading more because it was fun to just learn new things even if it did nothing to help my grades. I kept working out and trying to make consistent progress every day even though I no longer considered myself an athlete.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, I was able to find joy just working towards mastery independent of the achievement itself.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021 and I‚Äôve decided to set these goals for myself this year:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get promoted at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double my bankroll playing poker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a Substack that‚Äôs read by more than just sympathetic friends and family (<a href="https://bookie.substack.com/subscribe?">please subscribe</a>  ü•∫).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I‚Äôm not guaranteed to have any of these things happen, but they‚Äôre also not outcomes that are going to define my life. Instead, I want to use them as goalposts to focus my efforts in growing and evolving as a human being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought hope was a tenet of mental health. In some sense, yes. But not in the sense of making me a mentally strong player. "You need to think in terms of preparation. Don‚Äôt worry about hoping. Just do‚Äù</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs honestly kind of liberating to just accept the fact that I‚Äôm going to be a perpetual work in progress.</p>
<h3 id="be-conscious-of-what-you-do-and-why-you-do-it">#3: Be conscious of what you do and why you do it</h3>
<p>There is a common misconception about the benefits of having a poker-face: a stone-faced, unflinching glare some times accompanied by sunglasses even though you‚Äôre playing at night and indoors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7ee6c43-49ec-4a69-898c-c17a54b36627_400x266.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7ee6c43-49ec-4a69-898c-c17a54b36627_400x266.jpeg" alt="Phil Laak made an early exit on Day 1 of Event #9" title="Phil Laak made an early exit on Day 1 of Event #9"></a></p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: According to a 2009 study, observing someone‚Äôs hands is actually a much more reliable predictor of card strength versus looking at someone‚Äôs facial expression or body language.</p>
<p>Myth busting aside though, it is true that everything you do in poker conveys information‚Äîfacial expressions included. How much you bet, how you throw your chips in, or even how quickly you make decisions convey vital information to an observant player.</p>
<p>In a game that‚Äôs predicated on maximizing the number of probabilistic, expected value decisions, even the slightest edge that can increase your edge by 0.1% is well worth some additional attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never do anything, no matter how small it may seem, without asking why, precisely, you‚Äôre doing it.</p>
<p>-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs a lesson that applies to life as well as poker.</p>
<p>Popular consciousness seems to reward the bold and confident individual whose instinct is to act quickly in order to accomplish some impossible feat. Decisiveness is an admirable trait but the narratives around ‚Äúquick action‚Äù tend to over-simplify the level of thoughtfulness that goes into truly great decision-making.</p>
<p>Taking a pause and asking ‚Äúwhy am I doing this?‚Äù is really powerful advice. Don‚Äôt just do what‚Äôs expected of you‚Äîthink critically about what it is your action is ultimately trying to accomplish. You‚Äôd be surprised how often there‚Äôs a better way to do it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve tried to be more thoughtful about the words I use to communicate my ideas and feelings. I‚Äôve tried to be more intentional about my relationships and be more protective of time I have with loved ones. I‚Äôve tried to ask myself whether I‚Äôm going to do something because it brings me joy &amp; energy or if I‚Äôm doing it because I simply think it‚Äôs expected of me.</p>
<p>This idea dovetails nicely into my favorite piece of advice in the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never judge anything others do without asking the same question‚Ä¶How much time and emotional energy we‚Äôd save if we simply learned to ask ourselves why they acted as they did, rather than judge, make presumptions, and react</p>
<ul>
<li>Maria Konnikova</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs so easy to project your own beliefs and expectations onto someone else‚Äôs ideas. Excoriating someone‚Äôs decision-making rarely changes their mind, especially when we‚Äôre all just as irrational, emotional, and prone to personal biases shaped by our experiences.</p>
<p>Instead, take a minute and genuinely consider why they made that particular choice. Get a glimpse into their thought process, see what beliefs they hold dear, and empathize with how they see the same world you occupy.</p>
<p>That understanding is not only a powerful advantage at the poker table but foundational to any strong relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less certainty, more inquiry<br>
-Maria Konnikova</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a year characterized by feeling physically isolated from our friends and family, I‚Äôm personally excited for this idea of authentic curiosity to help strengthen my relationships with the people I love.</p>
